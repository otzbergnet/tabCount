# Tab Count 

## About

With Safari 13 Apple deprecated old style Safari Extensions (.safariextensions), which meant a large number of extensions became unavailable.

[@gingerbeardman](https://github.com/gingerbeardman) contacted me about [Safari Count Tabs Extension](https://github.com/adrianh/safari-count-tabs-extension), which was no longer able to run in the latest Safari builds.

The inspiration stems from someone else's work and I am grateful to both for mentioning it.
